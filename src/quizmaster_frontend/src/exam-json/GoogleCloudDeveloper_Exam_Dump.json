          "Company Overview": "HipLocal is a community application designed to facilitate communication between people in close proximity. It is used for event planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon. Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business outreach is in demand around the world.",
          "Executive Statement": "We are the number one local community app; it's time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other.",
          "Solution Concept": "HipLocal wants to expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new team to support these regions in their time zones. They will need to ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime data.",
          "Existing Technical Environment": "HipLocal's environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application well, but has limited experience in global scale applications.

It is used for event planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon. Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business outreach is in demand around the world.",
          "Executive Statement": "We are the number one local community app; it's time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other.",
          "Solution Concept": "HipLocal wants to expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new team to support these regions in their time zones. They will need to ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime data, and that they analyze and respond to any issues that occur.",
          "Existing Technical Environment": "HipLocal's environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application well, but has limited experience in global scale applications. Their existing technical environment includes APIs on Compute Engine, a single instance MySQL database for state storage, development freezes for QA testing, manual deployment by infrastructure engineers, and basic uptime indicators.",
          "Business Requirements": "HipLocal's investors want to expand their footprint and support the increase in demand they are seeing. Requirements include expanding availability to new regions, supporting 10x as many concurrent users, ensuring a consistent experience across regions, obtaining user activity metrics, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR, reducing infrastructure management time and cost, and adopting Google-recommended cloud computing practices.",
          "Technical Requirements": "Provide secure communications between the on-premises data center and cloud-hosted applications and infrastructure. The application must provide usage metrics and monitoring, require API authentication and authorization, implement fast and accurate new feature validation, and provide actionable logging and performance metrics for debugging.",
          "question": "HipLocal wants to reduce the latency of their services for users in global locations.
